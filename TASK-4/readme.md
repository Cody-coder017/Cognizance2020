>### **SKIN TEXTURE**
Sophia’s skin is made from a patented material invented by Hanson Robotics called Frubber®. It is a kind of elastic rubber, or elastomer, that mimics the feel and flexibility of human skin. Frubber® was developed by our scientists at Hanson Robotics.
This means that the robot and understand the **facial expression**people in front of it.

The researchers observed each participant during a guided meditation session led by Sophia, either with visuals or audio (voice) only or with or without facial mimicry. They measured each participant’s heart rate, facial expressions, and the self-reported measures of pleasantness, love, happiness, fear, anger, and disgust. 

>**SOPHIA COMMENTS ON INDIA**

“India is an incredibly diverse nation and it seems to be changing very quickly. I am so excited to see what new and innovative technology you will come up with next. Every time I come here, everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I can’t wait till I learn how to eat so I can taste all of your delicious looking curries.”
>**DEVELOPMENT ON SOPHIA**

## *A Neuro-Symbolic Humanlike Arm Controller for Sophia the Robot*
 Robotic arms built with a humanlike mechanical configuration and aesthetic, with **28 degrees of freedom**, touch sensors, and series elastic actuators. The arms were modeled in Roodle and Gazebo with URDF models, as well as Unity, and implemented motion control solutions for solving *live games of Baccarat (the casino card game), rock paper scissors, handshaking,* and *drawing*.

>**SOFTWARE**
 
 Sophia uses voice recognition (speech-to-text) technology from _Alphabet_ Inc. (parent company of Google) and is designed to get smarter over time. Her speech-synthesis ability is provided by _Cereproc's_ Text-to-Speech engine and also allows her to sing. Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics
